# Process-Health-Monitor

## Overview
The Process Health Monitor (PHM) is an analytics tool designed to analyze event logs, visualize process flows, detect bottlenecks and assess overall process efficiency. It demonstrates how automated data-driven process intelligence can assist organizations in identifying inefficiencies, ensuring Service Level Agreement (SLA) compliance and improving desicion-making in digital operations.
The tool has been implemented with a Python backend and currently deployed with a Streamlit frontend for quick deployment and interactive exploration.

## Why it matters?
In most organizations business processed evolve over time - people get added, steps multiply and what once worked efficiently starts showing cracks. Decisions on optimization are often made from gut feeling or anecdotal feedback rather than data. The PHM changes that by turning raw event logs into a clear, data-driven view of operational performance.

It answers critical questions every process manager or digitalization expert faces:

- Where exactly are the delays happening?
- Are bottlenecks consistent or random?
- Is the process truly meeting the SLAs or just "on average"?
- Which steps are candidates for automation or resource balancing?

 It provides three levels of insights:

1. End-to-End Performance — Evaluates overall throughput and SLA compliance.
2. Step-Level Performance — Uses z-score statistics to detect slow or inconsistent process steps.
3. Visual Insights & Reporting — Displays interactive process maps and trend charts, with one-click export to PDF. 

By applying simple but powerful statistical tools like z-score analysis, the app highlights abnormal process steps without requiring any machine learning model. It transforms process mining from a black-box exercise into something explainable, actionable, and aligned with continuous improvement practices such as Lean Six Sigma.

## How to use it?

The tool is designed to accept data in .csv format for now. For better results, make sure the data is organized into these columns below:

- case_id: customer name or order number
- activity: different steps that make a process cycle
- time_stamp: the time at which the activity occurs
- resource (optional): the resource who approved the particular activity (for eg. Clerk, Engineer, Manager, Sr. Manager etc.)
- cost (optional): the cost incurred by a particular activity step.

From the left sidebar, configure the settings and set the threshold values for SLA (hours) and the z-score.

The tool automatically processes the data, calculates key KPIs (mean duration, standard deviation, mean throughput rate, SLA breach rate, bottlenecks, etc.), and generates visualizations:

- Line Chart for case completions per day
- Process Map with key metrics

The tool automatically computes key KPIs, compares step performance statistically using z-scores, and summarizes results in a ready-to-download executive-style PDF report.
Bottleneck details can also be downloaded as a .csv file, and KPIs as a .json file.

It’s lightweight, fully modular, and provides the analytical foundation for continuous process improvement — essential for teams pursuing Lean, Six Sigma, or digital transformation initiatives.

You do not have any event-log data to test the tool? No problem! The app can generate realistic demo data with one click.

## Example Use Cases

- Retail or Supply Chain: Track purchase orders or fulfillment delays
- Finance: Monitor approval chains for invoice processing
- IT Service Management: Detect repeated SLA breaches in incident workflows

## Planned Updates

- Real-time process monitoring with live data ingestion
- Multi-level SLA configuration
- Machine learning-based predictive bottleneck scoring
- LLM based suggestions for process improvement
