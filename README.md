# Process-Health-Monitor

## Overview
The Process Health Monitor (PHM) is an analytics tool designed to analyze event logs, visualize process flows, detect bottlenecks and assess overall process efficiency. It demonstrates how automated data-driven process intelligence can assist organizations in identifying inefficiencies, ensuring Service Level Agreement (SLA) compliance and improving desicion-making in digital operations.
The tool has been implemented with a Python backend and currently deployed with a Streamlit frontend for quick deployment and interactive testing.

## Why it matters
In most organizations business processed evolve over time - people get added, steps multiply and what once worked efficiently starts showing cracks. Decisions on optimization are often made from gut feeling or anecdotal feedback rather than data. The PHM changes that by turning raw event logs into a clear, data-driven view of operational performance.
It answers critical questions every process manager or digitalization expert faces:

- Where exactly are the delays happening?
- Are bottlenecks consistent or random?
- Is the process truly meeting the pre-set SLAs or just "on average"?
- Which steps are candidates for automation or resource balancing?

By applying simple but powerful statistical tools like z-score analysis, the app highlights abnormal process steps without needing any machine learning model. It turns process mining from a black-box exercise into something explainable and actionable.
